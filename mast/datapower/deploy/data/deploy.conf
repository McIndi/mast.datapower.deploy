# This is a blank config file to be used with the deploy command
# if this file is in $MAST_HOME/etc/default and not in
# $MAST_HOME/etc/local then you have just ran the deploy script once
# and this file was placed into your default config directory for you.
#
# If this is the case you should copy this file into
# $MAST_HOME/etc/local and edit it there to reflect your environment.
#
# What follows is a guide for configuring your environment:
#
# Configuring Your Environments
# =============================
#
# This file is made up of stanzas with the following format:
#
# [section_name]
# option_1: value_1
# option_2: value_2
# ...
#
#
# The stanzas in this file should define the appliances and domains
# which are to be associated with the environments. Environment names
# are arbitrary, but they must be refered to as they are defined here.
#
# The stanzas in this file should be of the following format:
#
# [ENV_NAME]
# appliances: <space_seperated_list_of_DataPower_IPs_or_hostnames>
# domain: <DOMAIN_NAME>
#
# where <ENV_NAME> is the name by which you will refer to this environment
# from the command line.
#
# for instance, if you would like to deploy to appliances dp_1 and dp_2
# in domain qa each time you specify QA as the environment from
# the command line, You should define that as so:
# 
# [QA]
# appliances: dp_1 dp_2
# domain: qa
# 
# Now whenever you specify QA as the environment to which to deploy,
# it will go to the qa domain on both appliances.
#
# Configuring Your VCS
# ====================
#
# Also, note that the environment name will be used when looking through
# the SVN tree structure for any environment specific files and deployment
# policies.
#
# There is also one extra stanza which MUST be configured and that is the
# VCS stanza, this stanza defines the Version Control System you use
# for development of your services. It must be defined as follows:
#
# [VCS]
# type: <TYPE OF VCS YOU USE>
# server: <THE HOSTNAME OR IP ADDRESS OF THE VCS SERVER YOU USE>
# base_uri: <THE BASE URI YOU STORE YOUR DATAPOWER SERVICES IN>
#
# Where <TYPE OF VCS YOU USE> is the type of VCS you use, currently
# the following are supported:
#
# * git
# * svn (requires svn client to be installed)
# * TFS (requires TEE to be available on the system PATH)
# 
# and where <THE HOSTNAME OR IP ADDRESS OF THE VCS SERVER YOU USE> and
# <THE BASE URI YOU STORE YOUR DATAPOWER SERVICES IN> are just as they
# sound.
